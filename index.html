<p>The 1985 Chicago Bears can be considered one of the best NFL teams of all time. The Bears dominated their entire 85’ season with an almost perfect 15-1 record being led by the one and only coach Mike Ditka. What made them stand out was their impenetrable defense, AKA the Monsters of the Midway. The defense had players like linebacker Mike Singletary and defensive end Richard Dent who made every quarterback in the league fearful. The bears defense also had lethal weapons like running back Walter Payton, one of the greatest players in NFL history who carried the team’s offense with his exsplosive runs. He had an incredible season and showed off his ability to break tackles and make huge plays. The Bears most memorable moment came in the Super Bowl, where they crushed the New England Patriots 46-10. It was one of the most one sided Super Bowl wins ever. The bears performance in the Super Bowl confirmed their place in NFL history.  The bears did it all with style and even made a music video called the “Super Bowl Shuffle” before the Super Bowl. Even today, the 1985 Bears are remembered in Chicago and across the football world as one of the most dominant teams ever. Their legacy will live on forever. </p>
